# Cook the Perfect Steak 🥩🔥

Welcome to the **Cook the Perfect Steak** repository! Whether you're a seasoned chef or a culinary adventurer, this project will guide you through the art of grilling a mouthwatering steak. Let's fire up those grills and get cooking! 🍽️

## What's This Project About?

The **Cook the Perfect Steak** project demonstrates how to grill a steak to perfection using JavaScript. We'll cover everything from preheating the grill to serving up a juicy, flavorful steak. Let's dive in!

## The Steak Cooking Process

### 1. Preheat the Grill
- Set the grill temperature to a sizzling **204°C** (that's **400°F** for our Fahrenheit friends).
- Imagine the grill grates getting ready to sear that steak!

### 2. Season the Steak
- Grab your trusty seasoning blend—**Salt and Pepper**.
- Generously apply the seasoning to both sides of the steak. Let those flavors mingle!

### 3. Cook the Steak
- Here's where the magic happens. We'll keep grilling until the steak reaches the desired doneness.
- Our trusty loop will monitor the internal temperature of the steak.
- Adjust the grill temperature and cooking time based on the steak's weight and your desired doneness.
- Keep an eye on that steakTemperature variable—it's our culinary compass!

### 4. Serve the Steak
- Drumroll, please! 🥁
- If the steakTemperature hits or exceeds your desired doneness (let's say **63°C** for a perfect medium-rare), rejoice: "Steak is ready to serve!"
- But if it needs a little more love, console.log: "Steak needs more cooking."

## Usage Example

```javascript
const result = cookSteak(16, 63); // Cook a 16 oz steak to medium-rare (63°C)
console.log(result);
```
